Hi! My name is Aedan, I graduated from Yale (Silliman College) in 2020 with a B.A. in Statistics and Data Science. Since then I've been working largely in politics but with some stops in clean technology and academia. I love working with data to better understand our world and I'm particularly passionate about education, government accountability/transparency and criminal justice reform. I'm currently looking for full-time work while doing freelance projects for [Michelle Wu's campaign for mayor](https://www.michelleforboston.com/) and for the [Florida Immigrant Coalition](https://floridaimmigrant.org/). Beyond the world of data, I love to bake, play music and take photos. If you have any questions about my work or experiences don't hesitate to shoot me an email or connect with me on social media (Instagram or LinkedIn)!
